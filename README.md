# Wikipedia

The code is a Java program that queries the Wikipedia API for a summary of a given topic. It uses HttpClient to send HTTP requests and Gson to parse the JSON response. The code also includes methods to clean up the text extracted from Wikipedia. The only user interaction is through the console, where the user is prompted to enter a query.
